# ## 1 - System of Linear Equations and Corresponding `NumPy` Arrays
# 
# Matrices can be used to solve systems of equations. But first, you need to represent the system using matrices. Given the following system of linear equations:
# 
# $$\begin{cases} 
# 2x_1-x_2+x_3+x_4=6, \\ x_1+2x_2-x_3-x_4=3, \\ -x_1+2x_2+2x_3+2x_4=14, \\ x_1-x_2+2x_3+x_4=8, \end{cases}\tag{1}$$
# 
# you will construct matrix $A$, where each row represents one equation in the system and each column represents a variable $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$, $x_4$. The free coefficients from the right sides of the equations you will put into vector $b$.

# <a name='ex01'></a>
# ### Exercise 1
# 
# Construct matrix $A$ and vector $b$ corresponding to the system of linear equations $(1)$.

# In[5]:


### START CODE HERE ###
A = np.array([     
        [2, -1, 1, 1],
        [1, 2, -1, -1],
        [-1, 2, 2, 2],
        [1, -1,2, 1]    
    ], dtype=np.dtype(float)) 
b = np.array([6, 3,14, 8], dtype=np.dtype(float))

# ## 2 - Solution for the System of Equations with `NumPy` Linear Algebra Package
# 
# A system of four linear equations with four unknown variables has a unique solution if and only if the determinant of the corresponding matrix of coefficients is not equal to zero. `NumPy` provides quick and reliable ways to calculate the determinant of a square matrix and also to solve the system of linear equations.

# <a name='ex02'></a>
# ### Exercise 2
# 
# Find the determinant $d$ of matrix A and the solution vector $x$ for the system of linear equations $(1)$.

# ## 3 - Elementary Operations and Row Reduction
# 
# Even though the contemporary packages allow to find the solution with one line of the code, performing required algebraic operations manually helps to build foundations which are necessary for deep understanding of the machine learning algorithms. 
# 
# Here you will solve the system of linear equations algebraically using row reduction. It involves combination of the equations using elementary operations, eliminaring as many variables as possible for each equation. There are three valid operations which can be performed to bring the system of equations to equivalent one (with the same solutions):
# 
# - Multiply any row by non-zero number
# - Add two rows and exchange one of the original rows with the result of the addition
# - Swap rows

# <a name='ex03'></a>
# ### Exercise 3
# 
# Set up three functions corresponding to the discussed above elementary operations.

    # Note: for simplicity, you can drop check if  row_num_multiple has non-zero value, which makes the operation valid
    M_new[row_num] = M_new[row_num] * row_num_multiple
    return M_new

# ### Exercise 4
# 
# Apply elementary operations to the defined above matrix A, performing row reduction according to the given instructions.
# 
# *Note:* Feel free to add a return statement between the different matrix operations in the code to check on your results while you are writing the code (commenting off the rest of the function). This way you can see, whether your matrix operations are performed correctly line by line (don't forget to remove the return statement afterwards!).
